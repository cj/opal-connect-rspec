## MASTER

*   New RSpec versions
  * rspec-core - 3.3.4
  * rspec-expectations - 3.4.0
  * rspec-mocks - 3.4.1
  * rspec-support - 3.4.1

## 0.6.0 - Under development

*   Support for Opal 0.8/0.9 removed
*   Opal 0.10 support
*   Arity checking enabled by default
*   Dropped support for PhantomJS < 2.0
*   Removed `Kernel#caller` monkey patch so test file/line metadata is only available if supplied via test metadata or for failures. Should improve performance since an exception isn't thrown for every test to gather the data

## 0.5.0 (2015-12-08)

*   By default, any subject, it example block, before(:each), after(:each), and around that returns a promise will be executed asynchronously. Async is NOT yet supported for context level hooks. Async approach from < 0.4.3 will still work.

*   Update to RSpec 3.1 (core is 3.1.7, expectations/support 3.1.2, mocks 3.1.3)

*   Opal 0.9 compatibility

*   A lot more aspects of RSpec should work now as 20+ Opal pull requests were completed from opal-rspec work

*   Remove copy of source from opal-rspec git repo (and just rely on git submodule fetch)

*   Rake task improvements:
  * supports passing a test pattern (include and exclude) and FileLists besides 'spec/**/*_spec.rb
  * colors, formatter, and additional requires can be supplied from the command line via the SPEC_OPTS environment variable

*   Formatters:
  * Fixed issues with RSpec's BaseTextFormatter and made ProgressFormatter the default when run via the Rake task
  * Fix redundant messages with expectation fails
  * Browser formatter now works w/ progress bar and has a 'Dump to console' link that will put a clickable stack trace for a failed example in the browser console
  * JSON formatter supported

*   Fixed issues with constants/example group naming

*   Basic nodejs runner support

*   A lot more matchers enabled

*  PhantomJS 2.0 compatibility (also still compatible with 1.9.8). Thanks to @aost. Closes out https://github.com/opal/opal-rspec/issues/42


## 0.4.3 (2015-06-14)

*   Allow the gem to be run under Opal 0.7 and 0.8
*   Fix some threading issues
*   Avoid some other calls to mutable-strings methods

## 0.4.2 (2015-03-28)

*   Avoid phantomjs warning messages

## 0.4.1 (2015-02-25)

*   Remove predicate matcher fixes as Opal supports $1..$9 special gvars.

*   Update Opal dependency for ~> 0.6.0.

*   Remove double-escaping in inline x-strings (from Opal bug fix).

*   Remove opal-sprockets dependency - build tools now part of opal.

*   Replaced browser formatter to use html printer from rspec

*   Add timeout support to asynchronous specs
